Feature:
  In order to work with users
  As a user
  I want to use users API

  Scenario: It gets token for login and password
    Given the following Users:
      | firstName | lastName | email            | password     |
      | Test      | User     | test@example.com | testPassword |
    When I add 'content-type' header equal to 'application/json'
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/login_check" with body:
    """
    {
      "username": "test@example.com",
      "password": "testPassword"
    }
    """
    Then the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON node "token" should exist

  Scenario: It gets current user data
    Given the following Courses:
